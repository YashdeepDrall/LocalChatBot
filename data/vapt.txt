Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) is a security testing methodology used to identify weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications.

Vulnerability Assessment focuses on identifying known vulnerabilities using automated tools.
Penetration Testing simulates real-world attacks to exploit vulnerabilities.

VAPT helps organizations reduce security risks and comply with regulatory requirements.
