Personal Life and Controversies
Dutt's life has been marked by significant personal challenges and controversies. He struggled with drug addiction in his early years, an issue that began shortly after his mother's death in 1981.

In April 1993, he was arrested under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) for illegal possession of firearms connected to the 1993 Bombay bombings. While terrorism charges were dropped, he was convicted under the Arms Act and served a five-year sentence, being released in 2016.

He has been married three times. His first wife, Richa Sharma, passed away from a brain tumor in 1996. He is currently married to Manyata Dutt, and they have twins. He also has a daughter from his first marriage.

His life story was the subject of the 2018 biographical film Sanju.
