A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized unit responsible for monitoring, detecting, and responding to cybersecurity threats.

SOC Tier 1 analysts monitor alerts and perform initial triage.
SOC Tier 2 analysts investigate incidents in depth.
SOC Tier 3 analysts handle advanced threats and threat hunting.

SOC operations rely on SIEM, SOAR, and threat intelligence tools.
